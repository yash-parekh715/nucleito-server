Global mitigation scenario pathways indicate that more nuclear electricity is needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. Both the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report and the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook emphasize the significant role of nuclear energy, alongside other low-carbon energy sources, in transition pathways aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. Most low-carbon scenarios predict a doubling or more of global nuclear electricity generation by 2050. Additionally, nuclear heat and hydrogen can contribute to emissions reductions in non-electric applications, such as decarbonizing heavy industry and transportation, areas that are harder to abate. However, this additional mitigation potential of nuclear energy may not be fully accounted for in current energy transition analyses. To address this, the IAEA’s Atoms4NetZero initiative is assisting Member States in analyzing nuclear technologies and applications to support effective climate action. Unlocking and accelerating investment is crucial for the rapid deployment of nuclear energy, which has a proven track record of being deployed quickly, as seen in recent projects, to decarbonize the global energy system efficiently and cost-effectively. Achieving ambitious climate goals will require consistent climate, energy, and investment policies that recognize the need for nuclear expansion, alongside diverse financing strategies, efficient markets, risk management, and cooperation among stakeholders. Annual nuclear energy investment must rise to over $100 billion to reach net zero. By enhancing the availability of financing in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), these measures can help ensure a just, inclusive, and affordable energy transition.
NUCLEAR ENERGY IN PATHWAYS TO NET ZERO
In its Sixth Assessment Report, published between 2021 and 2023, the IPCC assessed over 3,000 peer-reviewed scenarios related to climate change mitigation. These scenarios explore diverse perspectives on energy transitions and offer detailed insights into the role of various low-carbon energy sources in achieving climate mitigation targets. Similarly, the IEA's annual World Energy Outlook also examines pathways for the development of global energy systems. Across these scenarios, the contribution of nuclear energy varies significantly. This variability is depicted in a figure that shows global nuclear electricity generation and energy-related CO2 emissions in 2050. Each dot on the figure represents a different scenario from the IPCC report, with colors indicating the projected level of warming (with a >50% probability). For reference, the 2020 level of nuclear electricity generation and energy emissions is represented by a circle.
Overall, an increasing role for nuclear power by 2050 is evident across a significant majority of scenarios, particularly those that achieve substantial emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. For example, more than 80% of scenarios with emissions below 20 gigatonnes of CO2 in 2050—approximately aligned with limiting warming to below 2°C—project an expanded role for nuclear electricity generation. Over half of these scenarios forecast at least a doubling of nuclear power, while around 30% predict a tripling or more compared to 2020 levels. The IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario also anticipates more than a doubling of nuclear electricity generation. Interestingly, the expansion of nuclear energy across many IPCC mitigation pathways exceeds the IAEA’s high projection, which is based on a detailed bottom-up assessment of market and policy trends. To fully realize the additional mitigation potential outlined in the IPCC scenarios, enhanced market and policy support will be essential to drive investment beyond current projections. Additionally, global supply chains, human capital, and other infrastructure will need to be bolstered to support the high levels of nuclear deployment seen in some pathways.
The IAEA annually publishes projections of energy, electricity, and nuclear power trends for the coming decades based on a thorough review of international and national forecasts, as well as input from experts. In 2023, for the third consecutive year, the IAEA increased its projections for nuclear power growth to 2050, reflecting a shift in global discussions about energy and the environment. As IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi noted in October 2023, “Climate change is a big driver, but so is security of energy supply.” Many countries are extending the lifespans of their existing reactors, exploring or initiating the construction of advanced reactor designs, and considering small modular reactors (SMRs) for applications beyond electricity generation. The IAEA’s 2023 high-case projection forecasts over 7,000 terawatt-hours of nuclear electricity generation by 2050, with 890 gigawatts of installed capacity. Although this is relatively conservative compared to some IPCC Sixth Assessment Report scenarios, which project up to 35,000 terawatt-hours, the IAEA's projections are designed to reflect current market and policy trends rather than extreme future possibilities. By contrast, the IPCC scenarios highlight a larger potential for nuclear energy to contribute to mitigation, which could be realized with additional market and policy support.
The IPCC mitigation pathways emphasize the need for a combination of nuclear power and other low-carbon energy sources to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. These scenarios show that the share of global electricity generation from both renewables and nuclear power increases in scenarios aligned with lower levels of warming. For example, scenarios projecting more than 3°C of warming tend to have a combined low-carbon electricity share of 20% to 40%, while those targeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C and 2°C goals show shares between 60% and 100%. Practically all scenarios include contributions from both renewables and nuclear power, with some showing up to more than 45% nuclear and more than 95% renewable generation. This highlights nuclear energy’s ability to support the integration of high shares of renewables, aiding in the achievement of long-term mitigation goals while also strengthening climate resilience.
The IPCC mitigation pathways emphasize the need for a combination of nuclear power and other low-carbon energy sources. Nuclear energy not only provides low-carbon electricity but also facilitates the integration of large shares of renewable energy, supporting long-term energy security and climate resilience. The global nuclear fleet has proven to be highly robust in the face of extreme climate events such as heat waves, storms, and droughts, making it an excellent complement to other low-carbon energy sources as climate risks increase. For instance, between 2000 and 2022, reductions in nuclear output due to climate events rarely exceeded 0.5%. In France, despite record low river flows in 2022 and one of the hottest summers on record, production losses attributed to environmental factors were less than 0.2% of annual nuclear power output. This resilience underscores nuclear energy’s crucial role in ensuring reliable power systems in a changing climate.
Nuclear energy, in addition to generating clean electricity, holds significant potential to provide heat and hydrogen for decarbonizing sectors that are less suited to electrification. These hard-to-abate activities include processes in industries such as steel, non-ferrous metals, cement, and chemicals, as well as heavy transport and aviation. However, the potential of nuclear energy in these areas is underrepresented in most current climate scenarios. In the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, only a small number of scenarios include nuclear-derived heat or hydrogen, and generally in negligible amounts. This limited representation suggests that the role of nuclear heat and hydrogen may be underestimated in current analyses. To address this gap, the IAEA launched the Atoms4NetZero initiative in 2022 to help its Member States better understand the potential of nuclear energy technologies in shaping their national strategies for achieving net-zero emissions. This initiative presents an opportunity to enhance energy transition models and broaden the understanding of nuclear energy’s role in decarbonizing various sectors.
Realizing the potential of nuclear energy is crucial for accelerating investment to achieve net-zero emissions. Decarbonizing the global energy sector by 2050, or even sooner, is essential to limit the average global temperature increase to below 1.5°C or 2°C, and this goal necessitates the rapid deployment of low-carbon electricity generation technologies. Nuclear energy has a proven track record of swiftly adding low-carbon electricity across nearly all countries. For example, the construction of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in the United Arab Emirates is set to add over 400 kilowatt-hours of clean electricity generation per capita per year, a rate that could contribute significantly to decarbonizing the global electricity system by 2030. Even in nations that have faced delays in building new nuclear power plants, the pace of deployment has often exceeded that of other low-carbon sources. Historically, the global deployment of nuclear energy has been more than adequate to align with the electricity mix projected in many 1.5°C and 2°C mitigation pathways. Achieving the electricity mix outlined in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario would require annual additions that are less than half of the historical peak deployment rates. However, the global deployment rate in recent years has been approximately three to four times slower than what is necessary to meet these goals.
To unlock the potential of nuclear energy, there is a pressing need to accelerate global investment and deployment rates from current levels. The IEA emphasizes that annual nuclear energy investment must rapidly increase to over $100 billion by 2030 to achieve net-zero emissions, rising from around $40 billion per year during 2016–2020. This investment would total more than $2 trillion through 2050, with funding split roughly equally between advanced economies and emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Growing recognition of nuclear energy's role in achieving ambitious climate targets, highlighted by the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement and various national commitments, serves as a vital impetus for accelerating investment. However, there is a risk that existing market and policy environments may not support the scale of investment needed for net zero. As Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, stated, “We need torrents — not trickles — of climate finance.” This challenge is particularly acute in EMDEs, necessitating concerted international efforts to enhance the availability of finance for the deployment of nuclear and other clean energy sources. To address this challenge, it is essential to align policy, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure to ensure efficient operation of energy and investment markets while embracing various financing sources. This includes traditional funding methods, such as government and vendor financing, as well as alternative and emerging sources of private, multilateral, and green finance. Establishing consistent investment criteria and frameworks, such as sustainable investment taxonomies, both nationally and internationally, is critical to guide investments and avoid arbitrary barriers. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that regulations and project approval processes are aligned with the urgent need for climate action and that energy markets provide the right incentives for long-term investment. Barriers to investment can also be mitigated by managing clean energy project risks through long-term contracts and regulated tariffs, facilitating coordination across different sectors, and supporting the development of emerging low-carbon technologies. A supportive policy environment, combined with improved access to finance, is particularly crucial for scaling up clean energy investment in EMDEs.
By 2030, an annual investment of over $100 billion in nuclear energy is required to achieve net-zero emissions.
Electricity accounts for approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the demand for electricity continues to rise. The ongoing development of new technologies, along with the increasing needs of emerging countries, could see the share of electricity in final energy consumption increase from 20% in 2023 to at least 30% by 2050. Relying solely on renewable sources to meet this growing demand may be challenging and insufficient, necessitating the inclusion of alternative low-carbon energy sources, with nuclear energy being part of the solution. However, nuclear power remains a contentious option due to concerns surrounding waste management. Nevertheless, policy initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction Act have enhanced incentives for existing nuclear power plants and facilitated the launch of new nuclear projects, allowing nuclear energy to play a significant role in the transition towards a net-zero future.
Electricity is becoming essential for achieving a net-zero transition, as it accounts for approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, including fuels consumed for electricity and heat generation. The demand for electricity is expected to surge in the coming years, driven by factors such as an improving economic outlook, advancements in technologies like electric vehicles, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, as well as demographic changes and increasing needs from emerging countries. The transition to a decarbonized economy also involves a shift toward electrification across various sectors. For instance, electric vehicles currently make up 15% of car sales, with projections indicating that this could rise to 40% by 2030. While electricity demand projections vary, many analyses suggest that the share of electricity in final energy consumption may increase from 20% in 2023 to at least 30% by 2050, with the International Energy Agency exploring scenarios where this share could reach between 30% and 50% by that year.
Is nuclear part of the solution? The IEA acknowledged in its 2023 World Outlook that a net-zero energy system cannot rely solely on solar or wind power. While both are essential for decarbonization efforts, they face challenges such as intermittency, land use constraints, and resource availability. Relying exclusively on renewables to meet the rising demand may be difficult and insufficient, highlighting the necessity of alternative low-carbon energy sources, which positions nuclear energy as part of the solution. Currently, nuclear energy accounts for 16% of global electricity production in 2023, maintaining a steady monthly output of 145 GWh (gigawatt hours) on average, with 413 reactors in operation worldwide, totaling a capacity of 372 GW. The United States is the largest producer of nuclear electricity, although it represents only 18% of the country's total electricity production, while in France, nuclear energy contributes to 64% of electricity generation. The latest COP28, the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, provided an opportunity for 25 countries to recognize the critical role of nuclear energy in achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Consequently, these nations collectively committed to tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050.
**Net Zero Needs Nuclear**  
Nuclear for Climate is a grassroots initiative that brings together nuclear professionals and scientists from over 150 associations to encourage dialogue with policymakers and the public about the vital role of nuclear energy in addressing climate change. Our vision is to create a clean, sustainable, and abundant low-carbon future for all. We aim to accelerate the global transition to Net Zero by 2050 through collaboration between nuclear and renewable technologies. Nuclear power is a proven and effective low-carbon energy source that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can replace our reliance on polluting fossil fuels. It is available, scalable, and urgently needs to be deployed alongside renewables to meet Net Zero targets. Moreover, nuclear energy is a flexible and affordable clean energy option that can complement the increasing supply of variable renewables, delivering efficient energy systems. Beyond generating electricity, nuclear power can also help decarbonize other sectors, such as heating and transportation, while promoting inclusive and sustainable global development that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As we mark five years since the Paris Agreement, we acknowledge the daunting challenge of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. The climate is at a critical juncture, and we must achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 to safeguard our planet's future. Currently, we are off track, and time is of the essence. COP26 in Glasgow offers a vital opportunity for nations to unite and take meaningful action, transforming our approach to climate change and moving toward achieving Net Zero. We call on all negotiators and policymakers at COP26 to embrace a scientific and technology-neutral energy policy that fosters collaboration between nuclear and renewable sources.
Nuclear energy is a proven and effective low-carbon energy source that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can replace our reliance on polluting fossil fuels. For over 60 years, nuclear power has been a key contributor to low-carbon energy, with around 440 reactors operating across 30 countries, accounting for 10% of global electricity production. It is the second-largest source of low-carbon energy, following hydropower. The lifetime CO2 emissions of nuclear relative to the energy it provides, known as carbon intensity, are very low, similar to that of wind and hydropower. Countries with significant nuclear and hydropower components, like France, which generates approximately three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear, also have the lowest per capita emissions among the largest industrialized countries. Since 1970, nuclear energy has helped avoid more than 60 gigatons of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions globally and has prevented an estimated 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths, with a potential additional 7 million deaths avoided by 2050 if nuclear power were to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. Despite the remarkable growth of solar and wind energy between 2000 and 2018, fossil fuel use has remained constant, constituting roughly 80% of the global energy supply, and there has been a decline in the share of nuclear generation, although nuclear output in absolute terms has increased. Countries that have shut down their nuclear plants in recent years have faced challenges in reducing their reliance on fossil fuels; for example, Germany’s share of fossil fuels as a primary energy source has dropped by less than 1% since its planned nuclear phaseout in 2010, despite significant investments in renewable sources. To meet Net Zero targets, new nuclear technology needs to be deployed urgently and at scale alongside renewables. Major international institutions, including the UN, OECD, and EU, agree that all low-carbon technologies, including nuclear, must be implemented quickly and extensively. The latest IPCC report indicates that the primary energy supply from nuclear will need to more than double by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Nuclear is a scalable technology with a limited footprint and has been deployed effectively in the past.
Nuclear energy has proven to be the fastest method for achieving decarbonization in terms of clean energy added per capita annually. A notable example is Sweden's nuclear program, which added 10.9 GWe of new nuclear capacity in less than 15 years, resulting in a 75% decrease in CO2 emissions per capita since 1970. Additionally, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have the potential to enhance large nuclear projects by reducing on-site construction time through modular manufacturing. This capability increases scalability and decreases capital costs and associated financial risks once established. Leading nuclear nations project that both small and large nuclear projects can significantly contribute to achieving Net Zero goals. Nuclear energy is also a flexible and affordable source of clean energy, capable of integrating with the growing supply of variable renewables to create efficient and affordable energy systems. While the rapid rise of renewables introduces volatility into energy systems, nuclear power offers dispatchable and flexible energy, enabling it to replace fossil fuels effectively. Ongoing developments in nuclear reactor design aim to improve operational flexibility and efficiency, allowing for applications like clean energy storage utilizing nuclear-generated process heat or hydrogen. New technologies, including SMRs, facilitate broader integration with renewables, supporting a more decentralized energy system that brings supply closer to demand. Recent research indicates that nuclear remains the cheapest dispatchable low-carbon technology and that decarbonizing electricity is most cost-effective when it includes optimal amounts of consistent nuclear generation. Furthermore, nuclear can support the decarbonization of other sectors, such as heating and transportation. While global electricity production is projected to increase significantly, it currently accounts for 40% of total greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly from fossil fuel sources. Fossil fuels also play a substantial role in other sectors, including transportation, heating, and industrial processes.
Nuclear energy has the capability to produce hydrogen efficiently, offering a viable alternative to fossil fuels and enhancing decarbonization efforts. Hydrogen generated from nuclear energy can also improve grid flexibility in clean energy systems. The concept of a clean hydrogen economy is gaining momentum, with a rapid expansion of related policies and projects worldwide. Additionally, nuclear reactors can supply heat for various non-electric applications, providing economic, environmental, and efficiency benefits. These cogeneration applications include district heating, industrial process heat, and seawater desalination. New advanced reactors, designed to operate at higher temperatures, have the potential to provide clean alternatives for energy-intensive applications, including polymer and plastic production, blast furnacing, and fertilizer production, as well as more efficient hydrogen production through high-temperature electrolysis or thermochemical methods. 
Furthermore, nuclear energy supports inclusive and sustainable global development, aligning closely with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It can help alleviate energy poverty by delivering clean energy worldwide, which in turn fosters high living standards, good health, a clean environment, and a sustainable economy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an average of 15 GWe of new nuclear capacity is required each year from 2020 to 2040 to meet the Sustainable Development Scenario aligned with the SDGs, which is critical for achieving a cleaner and more inclusive energy future. Approximately 30 countries are currently considering, planning, or establishing nuclear power programs, spanning from advanced economies to developing nations. Countries like Bangladesh, Belarus, the UAE, and Turkey are either constructing or have recently begun operating their first reactors, with several nations in Africa also exploring nuclear energy as a clean solution. 
Moreover, nuclear energy contributes to job creation and economic benefits. A recent study indicated that every Euro invested in nuclear generates an additional five Euros in EU GDP, and each direct job in the nuclear sector creates 3.2 jobs in the broader EU economy. Consequently, new nuclear initiatives can play a crucial role in the global recovery from COVID-19, generating long-term employment, fostering sustainable economic development, enhancing energy resilience, and propelling the transition to clean energy.
